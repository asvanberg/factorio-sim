# Factorio Blueprint Maker

This is a simple app that helps view blueprints and also allows you to export blueprints that you make using the grid into [Factorio][factorio-homepage] through the new 0.15 blueprint strings.

**N.B.** This app is still under heavy development, most of the various entities need to be added still.


## Features

 * Allow the importing of blueprint strings and loading them into the grid
 * Export a blueprint string from the entities currently on the grid


## To Implement

 * All Entities, currently only normal transport belts are supported, plans are to support all entities in the near future.
